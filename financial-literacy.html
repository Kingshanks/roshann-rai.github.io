                        <p>The number of DEMAT account holders in Nepal have reached approximately 58 lakhs in late June 2023 according to CDSC database. That is every 1 in 5 individuals has DEMAT account assuming 1 DEMAT account per person. This is a great achievement for a country like Nepal because more and more people are able to involve in the capital market. However, there arise a serious question. Does this increase in the DEMAT accounts indicate the rise in financial literacy of Nepalese or are people just openign the DEMAT accounts because someone told them IPOs are easy money? This essay revolves around this this particular question by attempting to explain the meaning of financial literacy, the need of financial literacy in changing economic scenario and policy frameworks necessary for improving the financial literacy situation for better financial resilience.</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">What is financial Literacy?</h2>
						<p>Simply, financial literacy means the ability of an individual to manage his/her finances. It represents the level of aptitude in understanding personal finance; awareness and knowledge of key financial concepts required for managing personal finances and is generally used as a narrower term than financial capability (<a href = "https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/901211472719528753/pdf/108104-BRI-FinancialEducationProgramsandStrategies-PUBLIC.pdf" target = "_blank">World Bank, 2014</a>). Financially literate people have the capacity to make rational financial decisions that is likely to benefit themselves, their society and the economy as a whole. It has three major components: knowledge, attitude, and behaviour (<a href = "https://www.oecd.org/financial/education/2022-INFE-Toolkit-Measuring-Finlit-Financial-Inclusion.pdf" target = "_blank">OECD/INFE, 2022</a>). Financial knowledge means the knowledge, information about different financial products and services. Financial attitude are the individual characteristics that take the form of tendencies towards a financial practice or action and shows the inclination or likelihood of a person to undertake a behaviour (<a href = "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288369577.pdf" target = "_blank">Ramirez-Montoya, 2017</a>). Financial behaviours are the actions one need to exhibit to achieve financial well-being that include: (i) managing their money, (ii) researching and seeking knowledge about financial decisions, (iii) planning and goal setting and (iv) follow-through the first three actions (<a href = "https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_financial_behaviors_that_may_support_financial_well_being_part_one" target = "_blank">Long, 2023</a>).</p> 
						
						<h2 class="section-heading">Status of Financial Literacy</h2>
                        <p>S&P Global Financial Literacy Survey 2014 is the most comprehensive global measurement of financial literacy which measured the level of financial literacy based on four financial concepts: (i) risk diversification, (ii) inflation, (iii) numeracy<a href = "#1" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup><font color = "blue">[1]</font></sup></a> and (iv) interest compounding. The survey found that only 33% of adults worldwide are financially literate of which 35% of men and 30% of women are financially literate. Risk diversification is the least understood topic among the four mentioned above. Though account holders are financially savvy, only 36% of account-holding adults are found to be financially literate. For richer countries, high economic development is tied with high financial literacy. However, the relationship doesn’t hold true in case of poor countries. Scandinavian countries are found to have higher financially literate population. Norway, Denmark and Sweden had 71% of adults financially literate while the USA had only 57% adults financially literate. In the SAARC region, Bhutan has the highest financially literate adult population i.e., 54% followed by Maldives (35%). Nepal has only 18% of adult financially literate while India has 24%.</p>

						<p>Nepal Rastra Bank’s financial literacy survey<a href = "#2" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup><font color = "blue">[2]</font></sup> conducted in 2022 found that 57.9% of Nepalese of age above 18 years are financially literate. Bagmati province has the highest while Madhesh province has the lowest financially literate population. Males are found to be more financially literate than females by 7.5%. The gender gap in financial literacy score has been found in all provinces with the gap being the widest in Madhesh and Sudurpaschim province. Likewise, Younger people (18-30 years) are more financially literate than older ones (above 60 years).</p>
