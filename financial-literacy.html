                        <p>The number of DEMAT account holders in Nepal have reached approximately 58 lakhs in late June 2023 according to CDSC database. That is every 1 in 5 individuals has DEMAT account assuming 1 DEMAT account per person. This is a great achievement for a country like Nepal because more and more people are able to involve in the capital market. However, there arise a serious question. Does this increase in the DEMAT accounts indicate the rise in financial literacy of Nepalese or are people just openign the DEMAT accounts because someone told them IPOs are easy money? This essay revolves around this this particular question by attempting to explain the meaning of financial literacy, the need of financial literacy in changing economic scenario and policy frameworks necessary for improving the financial literacy situation for better financial resilience.</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">What is financial Literacy?</h2>
						<p>Simply, financial literacy means the ability of an individual to manage his/her finances. It represents the level of aptitude in understanding personal finance; awareness and knowledge of key financial concepts required for managing personal finances and is generally used as a narrower term than financial capability (<a href = "https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/901211472719528753/pdf/108104-BRI-FinancialEducationProgramsandStrategies-PUBLIC.pdf" target = "_blank">World Bank, 2014</a>). Financially literate people have the capacity to make rational financial decisions that is likely to benefit themselves, their society and the economy as a whole. It has three major components: knowledge, attitude, and behaviour (<a href = "https://www.oecd.org/financial/education/2022-INFE-Toolkit-Measuring-Finlit-Financial-Inclusion.pdf" target = "_blank">OECD/INFE, 2022</a>). Financial knowledge means the knowledge, information about different financial products and services. Financial attitude are the individual characteristics that take the form of tendencies towards a financial practice or action and shows the inclination or likelihood of a person to undertake a behaviour (<a href = "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288369577.pdf" target = "_blank">Ramirez-Montoya, 2017</a>). Financial behaviours are the actions one need to exhibit to achieve financial well-being that include: (i) managing their money, (ii) researching and seeking knowledge about financial decisions, (iii) planning and goal setting and (iv) follow-through the first three actions (<a href = "https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_financial_behaviors_that_may_support_financial_well_being_part_one" target = "_blank">Long, 2023</a>).</p> 

						
						In 1958, <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809766" target = "_blank">Modigliani and Miller</a> published a landmark paper titled "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment". The paper concluded that firms' value is independent of the capital structure assuming that the capital market is perfect, there is no corporate tax and absence of transaction and bankruptcy costs. This paper sparked a lot of debate in finance domain. Later, <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809167">Modigliani & Miller (1963)</a> abandoned the assumption of tax free world and argued that the value of levered firm is greater than that of unlevered firm. Following these two landmark papers of Modigliani and Miller, numerous studies have been conducted on this topic which strongly suggest that capital structure can affect the firm value.</p>
                        <p>Now the question is how can financial managers mix the debt and equity such that the firm value is maximized. To answer this question, one must start by identifying the factors that can affect the capital structure decisions. Past empirical studies suggest that capital structure decisions are affected by firm specific factors like firm size (<a href ="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1995.tb05184.x" target="_blank">Rajan & Zingales, 1995</a>), profitability(Rajan & Zingales, 1995; <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1988.tb02585.x" target = "_blank">Titman & Wessels, 1988</a>), tangible assets (Rajan & Zingales, 1995; Titman & Wessels, 1988), non-debt tax shields (<a href = "https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeechieco/v_3a17_3ay_3a2006_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a14-36.htm" target = "_blank">Huang & Song, 2006</a>; Titman & Wessels, 1988), growth opportunities (Titman & Wessels, 1988; <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2330733" target = "_blank">Kim & Sorensen, 1986</a>) and external macroeconomic factors (<a href = "https://www.uh.edu/~bsorense/Gertler%26Gilchrist.MP%20business%20cycles%20and%20behavior%20of%20small%20manufactoring%20firms.pdf" target = "_blank">Gertler & Gilchrist, 1994</a>; <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3990066" target = "_blank">Demirguc-Kunt & Maksimovic, 1996</a>; <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-053X.2009.01026.x" target = "_blank">Frank & Goyal, 2009</a>).</p>
                        <p>This article is focused on the findings of my thesis titled "Impact of macroeconomic factors on the capital structure of manufacturing firms listed on NEPSE". The study was conducted with the objective to investigate the impact of macroeconomic variables on capital structure of manufacturing firms and to investigate whether the conclusions from past study conducted in other economies relevant in case of Nepal or not. The firms under the study were Bottlers Nepal Ltd. (BNL), Bottlers Nepal Terai Ltd. (BNT), Himalayan Distillery Ltd. (HDL), Nepal Lube Oil Ltd. (NLO) and Shivam Cement Ltd. (SHIVM). The sample period for the study was from 2011 to 2022.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Nepalese Economy</h2>
                        <p>Following the Comprehensive Peace Accord between the Maoist and Government of Nepal in 21 November 2006, Nepalese believed that the new era would bring rapid economic development in Nepal. Sadly, this optimism of Nepalese didn't turn into fruition due to the political instability, policies instability, rampant corruption and energy crisis. Apart from the political situation, earthquake of 2015, <a href = "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35041366" target = "_blank">unofficial economic blockade</a> and the <a href = "https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/post-covid-19-economic-conditions-in-nepal-and-political-instability/" target = "_blank">COVID pandemic</a> further worsened Nepalese economy. Nepalese economy is characterized by low economic growth rate, high inflation and high interest rate. The GDP growth has remained in between -2.4% and 9% during the period of 2011 to 2022.<a href = "#1" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The high 9% GDP growth rate was achieved during the post-earthquake reconstruction phase. Similarly, the average manufacturing value added share in GDP in the period 2011-2022 was 5.15% which was the lowest in the region.<a href = "#2" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

                        <p>During the period of 2011-2022, the interest rate of Nepal was very high. The average interest rate of Nepal was 10.88%. The interest rate was between 8.43% and 12.47% in the period.<a href = "#3" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The inflation was in between 3.6% to 9.9% in the period of 2011-2022. The average inflation rate was 6.9%.<a href = "#4" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Following the implementation of C-ASBA and NEPSE online trading system, there was huge growth in interest torwards the IPO. During the bullish phase, stock market capitalization to GDP reached 93.8% in 2020/21 up from 46.1% in 2019/20. Though there were scarce number of manufacturing companies issuing IPO, Nepal saw huge number of companies especially from hydro and microfinance sector issuing IPO after 2019. At present, SEBON is encouraging manufacturing companies by allowing them to issue IPO at premium.</p>
