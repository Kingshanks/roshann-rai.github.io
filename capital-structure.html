                        <p>In 1958, <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809766" target = "_blank">Modigliani and Miller</a> published a landmark paper titled "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment".  The paper concluded that firms' value is independent of the capital structure assuming that the capital market is perfect, there is no corporate tax and absence of transaction and bankruptcy costs. This paper sparked a lot of debate in finance domain. Later, <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1809167">Modigliani & Miller (1963)</a> abandoned the assumption of tax free world and argued that the value of levered firm is greater than that of unlevered firm. Following these two landmark papers of Modigliani and Miller, numerous studies have been conducted on this topic which strongly suggest that capital structure can affect the firm value.</p>
                        <p>Now the question is how can financial managers mix the debt and equity such that the firm value is maximized. To answer this question, one must start by identifying the factors that can affect the capital structure decisions. Past empirical studies suggest that capital structure decisions are affected by firm specific factors like firm size (<a href ="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1995.tb05184.x" target="_blank">Rajan & Zingales, 1995</a>), profitability(Rajan & Zingales, 1995; <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1988.tb02585.x" target = "_blank">Titman & Wessels, 1988</a>), tangible assets (Rajan & Zingales, 1995; Titman & Wessels, 1988), non-debt tax shields (<a href = "https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeechieco/v_3a17_3ay_3a2006_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a14-36.htm" target = "_blank">Huang & Song, 2006</a>; Titman & Wessels, 1988), growth opportunities (Titman & Wessels, 1988; <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2330733" target = "_blank">Kim & Sorensen, 1986</a>) and external macroeconomic factors (<a href = "https://www.uh.edu/~bsorense/Gertler%26Gilchrist.MP%20business%20cycles%20and%20behavior%20of%20small%20manufactoring%20firms.pdf" target = "_blank">Gertler & Gilchrist, 1994</a>; <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3990066" target = "_blank">Demirguc-Kunt & Maksimovic, 1996</a>; <a href = "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-053X.2009.01026.x" target = "_blank">Frank & Goyal, 2009</a>).</p>
                        <p>This article is focused on the findings of my thesis titled "Impact of macroeconomic factors on the capital structure of manufacturing firms listed on NEPSE". The study was conducted with the objective to investigate the impact of macroeconomic variables on capital structure of manufacturing firms and to investigate whether the conclusions from past study conducted in other economies relevant in case of Nepal or not. The firms under the study were Bottlers Nepal Ltd. (BNL), Bottlers Nepal Terai Ltd. (BNT), Himalayan Distillery Ltd. (HDL), Nepal Lube Oil Ltd. (NLO) and Shivam Cement Ltd. (SHIVM). The sample period for the study was from 2011 to 2022.</p>

                        <p>Following the Comprehensive Peace Accord between the Maoist and Government of Nepal in 21 November 2006, Nepalese believed that the new era would bring rapid economic development in Nepal. Sadly, this optimism of Nepalese didn't turn into fruition due to the political instability, policies instability, rampant corruption and energy crisis. Apart from the political situation, earthquake of 2015, <a href = "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35041366" target = "_blank">unofficial economic blockade</a> and the COVID pandemic further worsened Nepalese economy. Nepalese economy is characterized by low economic growth rate, high inflation and high interest rate. The GDP growth has remained in between -2.4% and 9% during the period of 2011 to 2022.<a href = "#1" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The high 9% GDP growth rate was achieved during the post-earthquake reconstruction phase. Similarly, the average manufacturing value added share in GDP in the period 2011-2022 was 5.15% which was the lowest in the region.<a href = "#2" style = "text-decoration: none;"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

                        <p>The average interest rate of Nepal was 10.88%. The interest rate was between 8.43% and 12.47% in the period 2011-2022.<a href = "#3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
